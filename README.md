# Tic-Tac-Toe

This very simple project will test my hypothesis as to whether it is worthwhile to train a deep-learning model to act as
the heuristic for a minimax-style search.  I am interested in trying this on more difficult games than Tic-Tac-Toe (such
as Go and Onitama).  Tic-Tac-Toe is a nice test case because it is very easy to determine whether all the infrastructure
needed to make the play and training system function is working correctly.
